UX --
    -- Short for "user experience", and is the design discipline focused on making products that place primary importance on a user's experiences and interactions.
    -- Wireframing is a technique used to sketch out web pages and views in a rough way that focuses on how elements are arranged and how users are likely to interact with them.
    
    -- Wireframing for UX
        -- Used to communicate four things:
            1. Structure: Your navigation and information architecture
            2. Layout: Page hierarchy and the placement of elements on the screen.
            3. Content: Give content light as an idea of how their content will be placed within the design.
            4. Functionality: Can describe how your product will work and how it interacts for the people using it.

        -- Low fidelity: Hand drawn sketch. A great way to flesh out ideas on your own or with your team. Fast to create and quick to iterate on. Anyone who can draw a square, a circle, and a triangle can create a sketch.

        -- More traditional wireframe: Balsamiq OmniGraffle Illustrator and UX Pin are just some ways to make traditional wireframes. A way to communicate the idea to your team, your clients, and your stakeholders. Can be very useful to explain your product and exactly what you're building.

        -- High fidelity: Clickable prototype. Let's you design interactions. Are the way to go when conducting usability testing. Axure, Keynote, or HTML with frameworks such as Bootstrap or Foundation.

        -- Sometimes a quick sketch is all you need, other times an annotated wireframe is more appropriate. It really depends on the project and the stage you're at. Should convey just the right amount of detail, no more.

        -- Few practical tips
            1. Keep them simple. Key to wire framing is speed and simplicity. We'll ultimately throw them away so they don't need to be highly polished.
            2. Use a grid. Grid's create structure and simplicity to your layouts. 
            3. Short, sharp annotations. Team members actually read wireframes more than any other document. SO make sure you add annotations to your wireframes. Keep them brief and to the point.
            4. Encourage feedback. Sharing your wireframes and encouraging feedback from your team members is a sure fire way to improve them. Stick them up on the wall and encourage your team and anyone else to give you feedback.

    -- Getting Started with Wireframes
        -- Wireframe: A basic visual guide used to suggest the layout of fundamental elements in a web interface.
        -- Invaluable in keeping everyone on the same page.
        -- Get a clearer picture of the elements that need to be built.

        -- Wireframes: Basic representation of design elements, used for communication and documentation.
        -- Protype: Interactivity, used for interactive user testing, UI design
        -- Mockup: Static visualization, branding, used for Stakeholder design buy-in.

        -- What to include in a wireframe:
            -- General elements when you plan every webpage: header, footer, sidebar and content areas.
            -- Content. What will be displayed on this page?
            -- Structure. How will the elements of this page be put together?
            -- Hierarchy. How will these elements be displayed in positioning, labelling and size?
            -- Functionality. How will these elements work together?
            -- Behavior. How do these elements interact with the user?

        -- Layered elements of a web page:
            -- Surface brings everything together visually: What will the finished product look like?
            -- Skeleton makes structure concrete: What components will enable people to use the site?
            -- Structure gives shape to scope: How will the pieces of the site fit together and behave?
            -- Scope transforms strategy into requirements: What features will the site need to include?
            -- Strategy is where it all begins: What do we want to get out of the site? What do our users want?

        -- What not to include in a wireframe:
            -- Graphic elements
            -- Lorem ipsum text
            -- Actual design: should show how the site will work, not how it will look

        -- Types of wireframes:
            -- Sketchy: It shows the client that this is an ongoing process, and they can criticize and freely manipulate the elements and placements.
            -- Digital: More formal and sophisticated look. Close to a  mockup. Especially good for clients who might have a hard time imagining the finished product with a sketchy wireframe.

    -- What is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?
        -- An MVP is the smallest thing you can build that delivers customer value (and as a bonus captures some of that value back, ie. gets you paid)
        -- A minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.

        Build-Measure-Learn Loop

        Ideas --> **BUILD** --> Product --> **MEASURE** --> Data --> **LEARN**
        Customer Interviews
        Demos
        Teaser Pages
        Smoke Tests
        Release 1.0
        Concierge MVP
        Wizard of Oz MVP

    -- How is a teaser page or demo a product?
        -- Many of the things above are really good tactics for testing interest in a product through the use of a faster proxy for the product like a teaser page or demo. But they aren't a product by themselves.

        STRICTER DEFINITION OF MVP
        A minimum viable product is the smallest thing you can build that delivers customer value (and as a bonus captures some of that value back).

        The directive of an MVP is first and foremost racing to deliver on customer value.
